# Image-Super-Resolution

## Using the Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network for Image Restoration

    - This network was published in the paper, "Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks" by Chao Dong in 2014.
    - We will be deploying the super-resolution convolution nerual network (SRCNN) using Keras.
    - We can use this model to improve the image quality of low resolution images.
